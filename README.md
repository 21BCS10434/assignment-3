EVEN OR ODD This contact provides a set of functions to check whether the number input is even or odd.
Requirements

Solidity version 0.8.0 or higher
Usage Interact with the contract using the following functions:assert(),revert(),require() The checkEvenOrOdd()
function takes an input number _number and determines whether it is even or odd. It uses require() to ensure that the
input number is positive. The assert() statement is used to check that the input number does not exceed the
maximum value allowed in Solidity for efficient computation. The contract checks whether the input number is even
or odd by using the modulo operator (%). If the input number is even (i.e., the remainder is 0), the function returns
the string "Even". If the input number is odd (i.e., the remainder is 1), the function returns "Odd".
If the input number is not 0, 1, or 2 (which should not happen because we already required the number to be positive), the function
